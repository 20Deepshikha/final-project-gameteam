## Car Race
### Description
We are planning to build a car/bike (TBD) race game. Basically, there will be road with multiple lanes and there will have different kind of obstacles. The vehicle will race through the road with increasing speed and the player will be responsible for taking the vehicle to the maximum distance possible without hitting the obstacles. There will be different levels to the game but it will be a continous level without break (so far).
